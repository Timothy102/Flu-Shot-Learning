# Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines by DrivenData

## Overview
Can you predict whether people got H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines using information they shared about their backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors?

In this challenge, we will take a look at vaccination, a key public health measure used to fight infectious diseases. Vaccines provide immunization for individuals, and enough immunization in a community can further reduce the spread of diseases through "herd immunity."
